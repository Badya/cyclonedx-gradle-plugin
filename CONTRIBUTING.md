# Contributing guide

We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome.
This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples...

## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in GitHub.

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing and what you would expect to see.

## Building the project locally

Just do the following:

```
git@github.com:CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gradle-plugin.git
cd cyclonedx-gradle-plugin
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

This will build and publish the new plugin version locally
